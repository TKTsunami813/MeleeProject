Example task


Base was this: http://codecommode.com/art/gifs/character_basic_attack_2.gif

I only wrote the code for one enemy. If there would be multiple enemies I would use another code to select the current enemy.

Use the key 'Tab' to select your action on the enemy. With 'Esc' you can undo your step with the selection. Use the key 'Space' to attack if you selected your attack.
